# CatchUp

üëê CatchUp is an app used for organising, finding and attending social events.

üî® It's built using ASP.NET Core, React, TypeScript and Mobx.

üå± This personal project is currently a work in progress, and is for me to develop skills specifically in ASP.NET Core, C# and TypeScript. It will:

-   Use a Web API in .NET Core with Clean Architecture using the CQRS + Mediator pattern
-   Include Identity and Authentication using .NET Core Identity
-   Use React as the client
-   Use MobX as a state management library

üíæ This README will be updated as the project progresses.
